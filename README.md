# Nyxx – A 6502 Emulator in Zig
A minimal 6502 CPU emulator written in Zig.

## Overview
Nyxx is designed with clarity and modularity in mind. It targets the Ricoh 2A03 — a custom variant of the MOS 6502 used in the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). This makes Nyxx suitable for building NES emulators, tools, or educational systems that simulate 8-bit era behavior.

## Pronunciation
Nyxx is pronounced **Nix** (`/nɪks/`), as in **Nyx**, the Greek goddess of the night. The name draws inspiration from Nyx and follows the tradition of Unix-like systems by appending an "x" to the end, forming Nyxx as a minimal, modern homage to classic systems.

## Goals
- Accurate emulation of 6502 CPU behavior
- Minimal codebase with educational clarity
- Build toward a complete NES-compatible emulator
- Exportable to WASM for web integration
