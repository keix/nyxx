# Nyxx – A 6502 Emulator in Zig

This is a simple 6502 emulator written in Zig. It is designed to be easy to understand and modify.

## Overview
Nyxx aims to faithfully emulate the MOS 6502 CPU used in many classic systems, including the NES. It focuses on clarity of structure, modularity, and correctness, making it ideal for learning, experimentation, or building upon for full NES emulation.

## Pronunciation
Nyxx is pronounced **Nix** (`/nɪks/`), as in **Nyx**, the Greek goddess of the night. The name draws inspiration from Nyx and follows the tradition of Unix-like systems by appending an "x" to the end, forming Nyxx as a minimal, modern homage to classic systems.

## Goals
- Accurate emulation of 6502 CPU behavior
- Minimal codebase with educational clarity
- Build toward a complete NES-compatible emulator
- Exportable to WASM for web integration
