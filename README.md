# Nyxx as a 6502 emulator written in Zig

This is a simple 6502 emulator written in Zig. It is designed to be easy to understand and modify.

## Overview
Nyxx aims to faithfully emulate the MOS 6502 CPU used in many classic systems, including the NES. It focuses on clarity of structure, modularity, and correctness, making it ideal for learning, experimentation, or building upon for full NES emulation.

## Goals
- Accurate emulation of 6502 CPU behavior
- Minimal codebase with educational clarity
- Build toward a complete NES-compatible emulator
- Exportable to WASM for web integration
